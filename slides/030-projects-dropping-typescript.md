# Projects dropping TypeScript

## Svelte

> My position is, types are fantastic, TypeScript is a bit of a pain … as soon as you use a .ts file, then you have to have the tooling to support that … there’s all of these points of friction when you use a non-standard language like TypeScript that I have come to believe makes it not worth it. So instead, we have put all our types in JSDoc annotations, and we get all of the type safety, but none of the drawbacks, because it is just JavaScript, everything is in comments, you can just run the code.
